## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Bhoomi, a web developer passionate about bringing ideas to life online. I'm your go-to person for crafting awesome websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I specialize in creating dynamic experiences with Vue.js and React.

I thrive on making websites not just functional but also visually stunning. Thanks to tools like anime.js, I add lively animations that make sites memorable.

In my journey, I've tackled various projects, from designing user-friendly interfaces to building robust applications. Every project is a chance to flex my creative coding muscles.

What sets me apart is my expertise in Webflow and Framer development. I love using Webflow to create responsive and visually appealing websites with ease, and Framer allows me to bring interactive and dynamic prototypes to life with precision.

Ready to collaborate on something amazing? Let's dive into the endless possibilities of web development together!
